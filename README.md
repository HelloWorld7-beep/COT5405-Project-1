# COT5405_Project_1
This is our COT5405 Project 1, where we are implementing a divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithm.

**To run the Divide and Conquer file:**

First compile it in the terminal with:
g++ -std=c++17 divide_conquer.cpp -o divide_conquer

Then run the executable with:
.\divide_conquer.exe

**To run the Greedy Algorithm**

`cd` into the Greedy_PD folder

Then run the tests with `python Data_Cleaning.py`, which includes the code for data cleaning and testing. `Greedy_PD.py` contains the main greedy algorithm as a function.
